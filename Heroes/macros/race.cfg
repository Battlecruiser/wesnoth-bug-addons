But even in case a man studies his whole life, he can never reach the same level as an Athvari. The Athvari have sworn to protect the lands of the sulthanate as they enforce the Law, which prohibits the use of magic, since it has lead to severe catastrophes in the desert realms. Nowadays, there are only a few Athvari left."

Djinn helped the people of the desert to build their enormous cities. When the Three Kings of K'thar abused the powers of magic, most djinn died, since they are susceptible to destructive magic. Only a few have found a safe place - either in manmade objects, such as lamps, swords or jewelry, or in men that agreed to host a djinn in their mortal body. United they form the mighty half-djinns that are both man and djinn. In the land of the deserts, half-djinns are not seen as bastards, in fact, they are respected throughout the lands, as their union symbolises the great bond between man and djinn that brought forth many good things to the life of both kin. Djinn hate Afariyaten more than anything else."
