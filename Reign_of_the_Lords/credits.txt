If you have any suggestions or ideas please post any comments on the wesnoth forum about this newest version of the 5 Lords Reign faction.

(Version 1.1.1) - I've tried balancing the factions more in the newest version, also a modification button in the multiplayer menu has been added to turn on and off the base wesnoth units advancing to these Lords, i've added and removed a few units and changed some of the code to fix it in the wesnoth unit database. (removed units: faerie spirit,catarphact,custodian,troll warlord,mage of storms,djinn - these units have been removed b/c a few were overly repetitive, some didn't have good pictures, some were unbalanced, and some didn't fit) (Added units: Elvish Avatar,Pheonix knight,Elvish deadeye,Elvish Vanquisher,Elvish Star,Arch Wose,Troll Giant)

(Version 1.1.0) - This new version is entirely independent of the base wesnoth and so does not mess up the normal unit upgrades. But i have made another mod 5  Lords Default Unit Advancements, which allows you to upgrade from the base units to all of these super awesome new ones. also got some more portraits, added a few new units, fixed a bunch of problems

(Version 1.0.3) - Sorry about the bugs in version 1.0.0 i've fixed them now, also added some new units, updated the images on some units, and added portraits for a bunch of them (thats why this version is a bit bigger then the last)
